1. Real-Time Translation & Voice Generation

Process speech on-the-fly and generate translated voice instantly.



2. Emotion Preservation in Translation

Ensure the translated voice maintains the same emotions as the original (happy, angry, sad).



3. Multi-Speaker Detection & Handling

If multiple people speak in a video, detect and translate each speaker's voice separately.



4. Custom Voice Selection

If a well-known voice isn't detected, let the user choose from pre-built celebrity voices
1. Voice Recognition & Matching (Shah Rukh Khan Example)

Use pre-trained speaker recognition models like SpeakerNet, Resemblyzer, or Wav2Vec2.

Maintain a database of well-known voices (e.g., Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, etc.).

Compare the uploaded audio with this database and identify the closest match.


2. Voice Cloning for Translation

Once the speaker is identified, generate a translation in the same voice.

Use models like ElevenLabs, OpenAI's Voice Engine, or Coqui AI TTS to genera
